# Real Estate website

Group project in first and only HTML & CSS course as part of the Frontend program at Nackademin.

As a team, we utilized Sass, Bulma, and a small amount of JavaScript in our web development project. Initially, we collaborated on designing and generating the header and footer using JS, which unfortunately caused some issues with image rendering on GitHub pages. Each team member then took responsibility for designing three HTML pages, while also offering assistance and discussing any necessary changes.

I focused on designing the "Till salu," "Kontakt," and "S채lj med oss" pages. For the "Kontakt" page, I implemented a JS feature that allows users to toggle a new required section of the contact form when they choose or unchoose "Kostnadsfri v채rdering" in the "V채lj 채rende" dropdown. Additionally, I used this project to continue researching accessibility best practices and applied my new insights to the project. For example adding aria-labels to links, using aria-hidden for nested icons, and adding rel="external" to external links.
