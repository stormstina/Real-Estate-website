# Real Estate website

Group project in first and only HTML & CSS course as part of the Frontend program at Nackademin.

We used Sass, Bulma and a small bit of JS.

We  worked together on the header and footer, genereating them via JS, unfortuantely causing an issue with the images on Github pages. Then we did three html-pages each, but asssiting and discussing as needed.

I was responsible for the "Till salu", "Kontakt" and the "Sälj med oss" pages. Using JS to toggle a new *required* section of the contact page form when the user chooses "Kostnadsfri värdering". In addition to that I spent a lot of time reading about accesibility and tried to apply my new insights to this project.
